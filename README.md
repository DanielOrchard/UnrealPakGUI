# UnrealPakGUI
A simple GUI for the Unreal Pak Tool, just to speed things up.

This is a very rough tool, it looks poor, its not fully functional. However the core of it works. You can package up directories, or unpack them, give it a filename, and choose a export path. 

I will update this one day, but for now, its doing what I need so its not going to change soon.
